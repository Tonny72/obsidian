It has a 2000mAh Lithium-ion battery which should give you around four weeks of usage with WiFi turned off.

It features an upgraded higher resolution and higher contrast E Ink screen, along with a faster processor and a more accurate stylus pen. Like the Sony DPT-CP1, Sony DPT-RP1 only supports PDF format and it can’t connect to the internet and you have to use Sony app to transfer files.

Enkel PDF
Since Sony Digital Paper devices only support PDF format, if you have an extensive collection of EPUB, TEXT or MOBI files, you can convert them to PDF by using[Epubor Ultimate](https://www.epubor.com/ultimate.html). Most importantly, it’s totally free to use Epubor Ultimate software to convert DRM free files to PDF.

- # Onyx Boox Max2
  [The Onyx Boox Max2](https://onyxboox.com/boox_max2)is Onyx’s latest 13.3” device with a resolution of 2220×1650 and 207 PPI, the third generation Max model. Aside from the larger screen, it’s mostly the same as the 10.3” Onyx Boox Note, but the Max2 adds a 3.5mm headphone jack, physical page buttons and a menu button, along with an HDMI port to use the device as an E Ink monitor. Like the Note, it has a quadcore 1.6GHz processor with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage space, so the performance is quite good for an E Ink device.
  If you want to view PDF files in full page view without zooming in or use the sidenote feature in landscape mode or use the E Ink monitor mode, then the large screen Max2 can best meet your needs.
