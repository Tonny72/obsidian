MYRRHA will be the world’s first sub-critical, particle accelerator-driven reactor to safely produce nuclear energy while solving the nuclear waste issue. But there’s still a lot of work to be done, such as constructing MINERVA – the project’s first implementation phase that consists of a 100 MeV high-power, superconducting particle accelerator and a proton target facility for the development of (new) medical radioisotopes. The beam commissioning of this accelerator facility is scheduled for 2026. As a Senior Automation Engineer, you will be responsible for defining component requirements of the software-based control and interlock systems (CIS) for the accelerator and proton target facilities. You will also follow-up the design, implementation and acceptance activities performed by external partners and execute integration tests. For this, you will report to the MINERVA ICS group leader and work very closely with other groups and external partners.

- elaborate requirements with system users for design and development by external partners
- participate in and contribute to the design of critical core systems and concepts with focus on PLC-based control and interlock systems
- technical follow-up of external partners including review (documents, code) and acceptance
- set-up integration test stands and perform integration tests with users
- create training material and guidelines to unify development activities (programming language, repository layouts, user interface and unit testing)
- coach and train users, primarily software and electronic engineers of external partners to follow in-house processes and guidelines
  
  To join this frontier, you'll need
- a Master’s degree or higher in Automation Engineering or equivalent
- 5+ years of work experience as a automation engineer, ideally in an accelerator control system project
- previous experience in design and development of PLC- based automation projects, ideally using Siemens S7 hardware and software with certified training
- hands-on experience with functional safety systems and knowledge of Safety Integration Levels (SIL), ideally using IEC61508, IEC62061 and ISO13849
- knowledge in software patterns and modelling languages, preferably Unified Modelling Language (UML)
- experience in automated testing of automation projects
- basic knowledge of version control systems (as user), for example git
- excellent people management and interpersonal skills
- spoken and written knowledge of English with the ability to draw up and review technical texts
