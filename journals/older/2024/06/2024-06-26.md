	- Samenvatting mails
		- Yazzoom is still POC but is going to phase 2.
		- The connection from Yanomaly to the SQL database is not supported (as such it was never used, the model was created offline), it seems it is still enabled for TLS 1.0, so should be changed to TLS 2.0 (@Stijn Vandenbroucke, @Tonny Lemmens, is this something you can take on?)
		- For phase 2, we also need to know how frequent the data in the SQL-database is getting updated from the various sources MES/LIMS/Abb (@Stijn Vandenbroucke, @Tonny Lemmens, can you confirm?)
		- Antwoord van Stijn:
			- For TLS [[SQL server]] Dessel: this is a known issue and there has been decided to wait for hci for a new SqlServer.
			      Wipro has tried to change tls (CHG0128725), but it caused other issues with impact on production.
			      *Question:* is it possible to dump the data in an Azure database?
			- For the frequency, I think we need to understand the need:
				- ABB: realtime data, can change per millisecond
				- [[applications/MES/MES]]: near realtime data, can change per second
				- LIMS: data is based on samples and samples are taken +/- every 2 hours, in best case analysis available within 20 minutes after sample has been taken
					- => Yanomaly needs 1 table where all data is flat in one record ; as LIMS is de 'slowest data generator' I should think that the frequeny can be max 'per 3 hours'
