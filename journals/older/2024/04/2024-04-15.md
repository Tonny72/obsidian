	- ### Verschil tussen S7-1200 en S-1500
		- |S7-1200|S7-1500|
		  |--|--|
		  |Max. 128 I/O points|built-in ethernet|
		  |No STL as programming language||
	- Recommendation: Use PLC data types instead of STRUCT
	- ### STOP mode in the event of errors
		- Cycle monitoring time exceeded once (when OB80 is not configured). OB80 'Time error interrupt" is called by operating system when the maximum cycle time of the controller is exceeded
		- Cycle monitoring time exceeded twice
		- Programming error (when OB121 is not configured). OB121 "Programming error" is called by the operating system when an error occurs during programming execution.
	- ### Organization blocks (OB)
		- OBs are the interface between the OS and the user program. They are called by the OS and control, for example, the following processes:
			- Startup behavior of the controller.
			- Cyclic program processing
			- Interrupt-controlled program processing
			- Error handling
		- #### Recommendation
			- Avoid the communication between different main OBs. They can be used independent of each other. If you nevertheless exchange data between the individual main OBs, use global DBs.
	- ### Functions (FC)
		- FCs are blocks without cyclic data storages. This is why the values of block parameters cannot be saved until next call and have to be provided with actual parameters when called.
	- ### Function blocks (FB)
		- FBs are blocks with cyclic data storage, in which values are permanently stored. The cyclic data storage is realized in an instance DB.
	- ### Global data blocks (DB)
		- Vaiable data is located in data blocks that are available to the entire user program.
