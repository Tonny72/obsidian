# [[JetBrains]] trials
- Trial [[Datagrip]]. Seems quit useless. Makes only connection to databases, but these tools are also integrated in [[dev/dev tools/pycharm/PyCharm]].
- Trial [[dev/dev tools/DataSpell]]: Usefull if one also uses R. But not for me.
- Trial [[Fleet]]. Product laks features. (refused to run if code path contains a space)
- Bought a license for [[dev/dev tools/pycharm/PyCharm]].
- The search function in [[applications/Obsidian/Obsidian]] is not good. Installed [[applications/pkm/LogSeq]] back again.
- prepare [[computer/Hardware/Laptop Sibelco]]
