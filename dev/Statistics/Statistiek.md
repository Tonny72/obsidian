  A percentile is**a comparison score between a particular score and the scores of the rest of a group**. It shows the percentage of scores that a particular score surpassed. For example, if you score 75 points on a test, and are ranked in the 85<sup>th</sup>percentile, it means that the score 75 is higher than 85% of the scores.

A percentile is **a comparison score between a particular score and the scores of the rest of a group**. It shows the percentage of scores that a particular score surpassed.
