**Subject:** RE: Replacement CON-X pc

Dear Tonny,

I did not find the reply for my message sent to you on 21.12.2018.
How is the situation with new PC and program reinstallation?
Did you find the CD with installation package from the delivery set?

Below are our answers to your questions:

We want to replace the old pc that is used for the CON-X measement in our plant in Maasmechelen. –

- It’s OK. Which version of Windows will be used for the new PC?
  For us Win 7 will be preferable since according to our experience MSPA_B could have compatibility problems with Win 10.
  
  What is the normal procedure?
- First, you need to install Firebird server. You should run Firebird-2.1.1*.17910-0_Win32.exe* from the installation CD. (See in the Attachment).
- Second, after the installation is completed, you need to copy the security.fdb file from the Common **MSPA_B** installation disk directory to the Firebird C: \\ Program Files \\ Firebird \\ Firebird_2\_1 \\ directory (for Win7, 32) or to C: \\ Program Files (x86) \\ Firebird \\ Firebird_2\_1 \\ (For Win764).
- To install the MSPA_B program, simply copy the MSPA_B directory from the old PC to new drive C: and restart the computer.
  Do we provide the pc with the required hardware serial card or is the pc included in the maintenance contract and do you provide one?
- Maintenance and support of the software is not included in the current service contract but we provide this on a regular basis on your request.
- MSPA_B software is protected by the lisence.
  However if you copy the directory and executive file mspa_B.exe from the old PC to the corresponding file on C disk (C\\:MSPA_B) of the new PC the licence is valid.
  
  Can we copy the software (directory) to the new pc or does it have to be reinstalled by you?
- In case of problem we will check the problem remotely.
- Please inform us if something goes wrong. We can contact to the developer of the software and ask him for support and help.
  
  Best regards
  Elena Hasikova

  Dear Tonny,
  
  Do you still keep the CD that had come with the analyzer in the 2011-2012?
  That time it was included in the delivery set.
  Or copy of installation files and MSPA_B program with appropriate hardware serial numbers can be also saved on C\\: of the old PC.
  Please let us know if available.
  We will try to help but after Cristmas holidays. Now none in the office.
  Since remote access has not been checked very long (from the time of Sigmar Fries retirement) it would be good to try it also.
  
  Best regards
  Elena Hasikova
