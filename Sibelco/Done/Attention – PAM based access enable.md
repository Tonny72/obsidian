**Why are you receiving this message?**
Since you have accessed one or more of the attached list of windows servers in the past, you are identified to participate in PAM Production roll out implementation to validate usage of new access administration tool (**CA Privilege Access Management**) that will help us managing security policies on Sibelco Servers to ensure a safe access environment.
**Description**
In order to support Sibelco’s move towards standardized infrastructure and enhanced applications, we are creating a more secure IS environment. We will introduce a tool called “CA Privileged Access Manager” (**CA PAM**) to centrally manage privileged user policies across virtual and psychical servers. This will ensure that all users who have access to specific windows servers benefit from the same security policies and safe access environment.
After **24<sup>th</sup> January 2020,** attached list of windows servers that are accessible through **CA PAM,** hence verify your access to the respective servers using PAM tool. After sometime your remote desktop and any other access to these servers will be disabled.
**What is expected from you?**
If you notice any issues while accessing the said windows servers or any impact caused, please inform <Krishnan.srinivasan@wipro.com> or contact the Global Service Desk via the [Self Service Portal](https://clicktime.symantec.com/3JjB26tqEdmJdwEx225eELN7Vc?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsibelco.service-now.com%2Flogin.do) or Skype Chat immediately. We will then ensure your access restored.
Your access is already enabled on PAM tool to access attached list of windows server, please follow the below steps to access the windows server
1.  Install/access to PAM client using the [instruction manual](https://sibelco.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/S88/Shared%20Documents/03_Information%20Services/PAM/Sibelco-CAPAM-EndUserGuide_v0.02.docx?d=w5c82831dde39413da26f538fd65cc3bd&csf=1&e=5Tq72g).
2.  Log in to PAM client using your active directory user-id and password with MFA. [Click here](https://sibelco.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/S88/Shared%20Documents/03_Information%20Services/PAM/CAPAM%20-%20MFA%20USERID%20LIST.xlsx?d=w4d02f16c1216421c929bc7cd679d7e4d&csf=1&e=WvneaC) to find your CAPAM login details of active directory ID.
3.  Once you log in, check attached list of windows servers that are available in the PAM client’s home page as per your current access to these servers.
